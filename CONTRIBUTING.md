## You Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, i assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/danyaridiger/vue3-extended-multiselect/blob/master/README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/danyaridiger/vue3-extended-multiselect/issues) that might help you.

Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.


#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
